## Biography

My name is **Piergiorgio Panero** and I am an Italian mathematician, currently in France. 
Keen on:
1. Data Science, 
2. Algebraic Topology, 
3. Topological Data Analysis.

I would like to understand how Git works, and try to use it in order to show my coding and technical skills.

*BUT HOW??* 

May I insert link? Like this: [Piergiorgio Panero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piergiorgio-panero-8922691aa/)
This is my LinkedIn page, not very up to date nor interesting, but you may give a look anyway.

Probably I may even learn how to create a website here, so to show everyone my CV's and projects.
